Hello! This is one of the simple applications I developed as a test assignment. 

Please keep in mind that while working on test assignment I strictly follow the app requirements 

## What was the goal

Develop an application which allows users to search youtube videos by keywords, and save their search queries.

You should avoid using any third-party UI libraries or CSS frameworks.

App requirements:

1) Work with Youtube API
2) Authorization through json file, token and local storage
3) The list and grid views of search results
4) The "Favorite requests" feature
5) The app should have adaptive and responsive design

## How to run the app

Clone the repository to your local machine and simply use `npm i` and `npm start` to launch the app. 

The live version of the app is available here https://youtube-seven-iota.vercel.app/

You can use the following credentials to test it:

 - **Username**: John 
 - **Password**: qwerty
