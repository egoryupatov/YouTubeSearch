Hi! This is one of the apps I developed as a test assignment.

Please keep in mind that when working on a test assignment, I strictly follow the specified requirements and don't use every possible technology that I have experience with or want to use.

## App requirements

Develop an application which allows users to search YouTube videos by keywords, and save their search queries.

Use the attached Figma template and avoid using any third-party UI libraries or CSS frameworks.

## App features

The app features:

1) Adaptive and responsive design
2) Interaction with YouTube Api
2) Authorization through json file, token and local storage
3) The list and grid views of search results
4) The "Favorite requests" feature

## Used technologies

* Language - JavaScript/TypeScript
* Framework/library - React
* State management - Redux + Thunk
* Routing - React Router
* CSS - SASS
* Database (or imitation) - local storage

## How to run the app

1) Clone the project repository to your local machine
2) Navigate into the project directory
3) Install the dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
